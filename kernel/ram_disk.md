# What Does RAM Disk Mean?
A RAM disk is a representation of a hard disk using RAM resources, and it can take the form of a hardware device or a virtual disk. In software, it is basically a block of memory that is being treated as if it were a hard disk drive through the use of dedicated software, which takes a block from the RAM pool and uses it as a dedicated storage area as if it were a hard drive, but with exceedingly faster performance compared to a hard disk. In the form of a hardware device, it is just a bunch of RAM cards or sticks housed together in a case with drive electronics to make it interact with disk drive technologies such as SATA and IDE, and a backup battery so that data is not lost.
